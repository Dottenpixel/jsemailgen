			</span><span class="storyBody">On June 10, Rep. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) sent a letter to FCC Chairman Julius Genachowski urging &quot;the Commission to withdraw its Title II classification effort and work with the Chairs of the appropriate Congressional committees to develop a suitable and clear statute that will help us achieve our national broadband goals.&quot;</span>
			</p>
			<p><span class="storyHeader">Dorgan Sends Letter Highlighting Rural Concerns with the NBP</span><br />
				<span class="storyBody">On June 10, twenty-one Senators sent a letter to FCC Chairman Genachowski expressing their concern that some policies outlined in the NBP &quot;have the potential to set the United States on a course toward a greater digital divide between urban and rural areas.&quot; In particular, the letter points to a proposal that advocates downstream speed goals of only 4mbps for rural areas and 100mbps for densely populated areas.</span>
			</p>
			<p><span class="storyHeader">Online Accessibility Hearing</span><br />
				<span class="storyBody">On June 10, the House Commerce Subcommittee on Communications held a hearing on &quot;H.R. 3101, the Twenty-First Century Communications and Video Accessibility Act of 2009.&quot; Witnesses included NCTA's James Assey; Sergeant Major Jesse R. Acosta, United States Army (Retired), American Council of the Blind; Bobby Franklin, CTIA – The Wireless Association; Lise Hamlin, Hearing Loss Association of America; Walter McCormick, United States Telecom Association (USTA); and Gary Shapiro, Consumer Electronics Association (CEA).<br />
				<br />
				During opening statements, Rep. Rick Boucher (D-VA) discussed the need to update laws concerning access to communications services and video programming by persons with disabilities. He applauded voluntary measures by companies developing accessible technologies. Such companies include Disney, CBS and You Tube, which are offering closed captioning over the Internet. Boucher said H.R. 3101 was an outstanding starting point for a collaborative effort to meet the needs of the disabled community while also giving industry the flexibility and incentives needed to move forward successfully. </span></p>
			<p><span class="storyHeader">House Appropriations Subcommittee Holds Hearing on FCC Funding</span><br />
				<span class="storyBody">On June 9, the House Appropriations Financial Services and General Government Subcommittee held a hearing on the FCC's 2011 Budget Request. FCC Chairman Julius Genachowski testified.<br />
				In his opening statement, Chairman Jose Serrano (D-NY) said it is essential for the FCC to have authority over the Internet and he is looking forward to the FCC starting proceedings to classify broadband as a Title II service. He also expressed his disappointment that the National Broadband Plan does not do more for PEG channels.<br />
				Ranking Member Jo-Ann Emerson (R-MO) expressed her concern with Title II classification and her support for broadband deployment in rural areas.</span>
			</p>
			<p><span class="storyHeader">Broadband Internet Technical Advisory Group Launched</span><br />
				<span class="storyBody">Also on June 9, a leading group of broadband Internet providers, high tech companies and content providers joined Adjunct Professor Dale Hatfield of the University of Colorado at Boulder in announcing the formation of the Broadband Internet Technical Advisory Group (TAG) – a voluntary group comprised of engineers and technical experts with the common goal of developing a consensus on network management practices and other issues related to a consumer's experience online. Participants agreed that the TAG's mission could also include: (1) educating policymakers on such technical issues; (2) attempting to address specific technical matters in an effort to minimize related policy disputes; and (3) serving as a sounding board for new ideas and network management practices. NCTA President &amp; CEO Kyle McSlarrow released a statement congratulating the group on its formation and pointing out that &quot;all companies participating in the Internet ecosystem should come together with a common purpose – to continue providing consumers with a great Internet experience.&quot; McSlarrow also released a blog entry on CableTechTalk.Sen. Olympia Snowe (R-ME) released a statement applauding the groups' formation and stating that, &quot;[g]iven the rapid advancement in Internet technology and innovation, the creation of a Technical Advisory Group will serve as an invaluable resource to the Internet community, the public, and policymakers alike…I look forward to learning more about this group as it is formalized in the coming months, because the TAG should provide a much-needed technical voice to the ongoing dialog on many of the issues we are facing today.&quot;</span>

			<p><span class="storyHeader">Senate Commerce Committee Markup</span><br />
