Participants agreed that the TAG's mission could also include: (1) educating policymakers on such technical issues; (2) attempting to address specific technical matters in an effort to minimize related policy disputes; and (3) serving as a sounding board for new ideas and network management practices. NCTA President &amp; CEO Kyle McSlarrow released a statement congratulating the group on its formation and pointing out that &quot;all companies participating in the Internet ecosystem should come together with a common purpose – to continue providing consumers with a great Internet experience.&quot; McSlarrow also released a blog entry on CableTechTalk.Sen. Olympia Snowe (R-ME) released a statement applauding the groups' formation and stating that, &quot;[g]iven the rapid advancement in Internet technology and innovation, the creation of a Technical Advisory Group will serve as an invaluable resource to the Internet community, the public, and policymakers alike…I look forward to learning more about this group as it is formalized in the coming months, because the TAG should provide a much-needed technical voice to the ongoing dialog on many of the issues we are facing today.&quot;</span>
